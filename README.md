## Useful hotkeys scripts to increase productivity



These scripts are powered by [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/). They are a result of frustation with repetitive tasks
and intented to increase productivity. Available just for Windows for now.

## Some of them are...

1. close_all_chromes.ahk (closes all windows of Chrome Browser. WHAT?! The task already do this. Although, when you have a normal Chrome and a Chrome Automation this script is worth)
2. drag_file.ahk (can be used to drag a file into somewhere used by any automation)
3. keyremapp.ahk (intented to be a custom remapping of dead keys, unused keys and etc)
